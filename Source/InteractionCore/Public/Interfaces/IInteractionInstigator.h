 * Interface for an object that can instigate interactions.

 *
 * Allows for an actor to add an arbitrator to the interaction process.
 * For example, some games present the user with a menu to pick which interaction they want to perform.
 * This will allow you to take the multiple matches (Assuming your InteractionOption generates more than one option).
